## Project Overview

This case study explores the application of Machine Learning in predicting machine failures, a critical aspect of predictive maintenance in industrial settings. The project was completed as part of the Machine Learning course at the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Problem Statement

In modern manufacturing, unexpected machine failures can lead to significant production losses and maintenance costs. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict potential machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance.

## Dataset and Features

The dataset includes various sensor measurements and machine parameters:
- Air temperature
- Process temperature
- Rotational speed
- Torque
- Tool wear
- Machine failure indicators

## Methodology

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Handling imbalanced classes
   - Feature engineering

2. **Model Development**
   - Multiple models comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Cross-validation

3. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC analysis
   - Confusion Matrix

## Key Findings

[Note: You can find the complete technical implementation and detailed analysis in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xenophobed/Notebooks/blob/main/ML/Colorado_Bolder_ML_Final_Machine_Failure_Detection.ipynb)]

## Business Impact

This predictive maintenance solution can help manufacturing companies:
- Reduce unexpected downtime
- Optimize maintenance schedules
- Lower maintenance costs
- Extend machine lifetime

## Technical Implementation

For those interested in the technical details, the project uses:
- Python for data analysis and modeling
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in industrial settings, showing how data-driven approaches can transform traditional maintenance practices into proactive strategies.
